# NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

The **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)**, released in January 2023, provides guidance for organizations to identify, assess, and manage risks associated with AI systems. It is designed to be voluntary, flexible, and adaptable across sectors.

## Core Functions
The AI RMF is organized around four key functions:

1. **Govern** – Establish policies, procedures, and organizational structures for AI risk management.
2. **Map** – Contextualize AI systems, intended use, and risks.
3. **Measure** – Assess AI systems for trustworthiness, fairness, robustness, and performance.
4. **Manage** – Prioritize and respond to risks to ensure continuous monitoring and accountability.

## Key Principles
- Trustworthy AI requires attention to **fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and security**.
- Emphasizes socio-technical considerations, not just technical performance.
- Encourages organizational culture around **responsible AI adoption**.
