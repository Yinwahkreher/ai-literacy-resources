## 🎯 Purpose

The AI Assessment Scale provides a nuanced practical framework for integrating AI into **educational assessments**, helping educators, institutions, and policymakers balance innovation with integrity. It helps educators **specify and communicate acceptable uses of GenAI in assessments**, moving beyond “ban/allow” to **clear levels with conditions and safeguards**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

It offers a spectrum of approaches — from traditional human-only assessment to AI-augmented and AI-generated work — and defines the **conditions and safeguards** needed at each stage.
