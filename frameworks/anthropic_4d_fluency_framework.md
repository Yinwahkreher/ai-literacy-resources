# Anthropic AI Fluency Framework (4D)

**Source:** [Anthropic AI Fluency](https://www.anthropic.com/ai-fluency/overview)  
**Purpose:** A practical framework for developing the skills to work effectively, responsibly, and safely with AI systems.

## üß≠ The Four Dimensions (4D)

1. **Delegation**  
   Deciding *what tasks* to give to AI, and when to rely on human judgment.  
   - Which parts of a workflow can AI handle reliably?  
   - When is human oversight essential?  

2. **Description**  
   Formulating clear instructions, prompts, and context for AI systems.  
   - How do you frame questions to get useful, accurate answers?  
   - What constraints or context should you include?  

3. **Discernment**  
   Critically evaluating AI outputs for quality, accuracy, and alignment with goals.  
   - Does this output make sense?  
   - Is it free from obvious bias, errors, or hallucinations?  

4. **Diligence**  
   Taking responsibility for the ethical and practical implications of AI use.  
   - Are you checking for risks and unintended consequences?  
   - How are you ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance?

## üîë Why It Matters

- Helps individuals and teams build **AI literacy** beyond just tool use.  
- Encourages **responsible adoption** by pairing technical use with ethical reflection.  
- Applies across domains: research, education, healthcare, business, and more.

## üìò How to Use in Practice

- **In teaching:** Use the 4Ds as discussion prompts or reflection checkpoints.  
- **In research:** Document each D when integrating AI into methodology.  
- **In training:** Create exercises that practice delegation, prompt design, output evaluation, and risk review.
