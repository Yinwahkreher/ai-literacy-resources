# EU AI Act (Basics)

The **European Union AI Act** is the world’s first comprehensive AI regulation. Adopted in 2024, it provides a **risk-based framework** to govern the development and deployment of AI across member states.

## Risk Categories
1. **Unacceptable Risk** – AI practices banned outright (e.g., social scoring, manipulative AI).
2. **High Risk** – AI systems used in critical areas (healthcare, employment, education, public services) require strict compliance, audits, and oversight.
3. **Limited Risk** – AI systems with transparency requirements (e.g., chatbots must disclose they are AI).
4. **Minimal Risk** – No additional regulation beyond existing laws.

## Key Provisions
- Transparency and documentation requirements.
- Human oversight for high-risk AI.
- Heavy fines for non-compliance (up to 6% of global turnover).
- Establishes the **European AI Office** to enforce the Act.
