## 🎯 Purpose

To help organizations understand their level of readiness for AI adoption across six foundational pillars, and position themselves along a spectrum from unprepared to fully prepared.

---

## 🧱 Pillars Assessed

1. Strategy  
2. Infrastructure  
3. Data  
4. Governance  
5. Talent  
6. Culture  

---

## 📊 Readiness Levels & Scoring

- **Fully Prepared — Pacesetters** (score > 86)  
- **Moderately Prepared — Chasers** (score 61–85)  
- **Limited Preparedness — Followers** (score 31–60)  
- **Unprepared — Laggards** (score 0–30)  

---

## 🌐 Additional Notes

- The assessment is tied to a **2024 survey** of ~8,000 organizations, implying global benchmarking.  
- Organizations may choose which pillars they want to assess (i.e. not all six need to be selected).  
- The tool emphasizes the need for balanced readiness—not just tech, but governance, culture, etc.
