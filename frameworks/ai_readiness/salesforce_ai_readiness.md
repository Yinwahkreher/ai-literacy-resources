2. **Data** – Evaluating whether organizational data is clean, accessible, and AI-ready.  
3. **Ethics** – Safeguards around fairness, bias, and transparency.  
4. **Customer Impact** – How AI adoption improves customer experience and business outcomes.  
5. **Organizational Preparedness** – Workforce skills, change management, and cultural readiness.
