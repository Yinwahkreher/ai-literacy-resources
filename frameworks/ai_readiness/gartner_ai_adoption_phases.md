# Gartner Artificial Intelligence Maturity Model  

Gartner’s **Artificial Intelligence Maturity Model** provides a phased roadmap for organizations adopting AI. It identifies five stages of maturity and highlights the importance of use cases, governance, budget, and organizational frameworks in progressing toward AI-enabled transformation.  

---

## The Five Phases  

1. **Plan**  
   - Select and prioritize AI use cases.  
   - Frame initial use cases with clear business alignment.  
   - Often begins with ad hoc processes for selecting AI technologies.  

2. **Experiment**  
   - Run pilots to prove the value of AI initiatives.  
   - Establish measurable business value from pilot projects.  
   - Use cases should be quantifiable and demonstrate clear ROI.  

3. **Stabilize**  
   - Develop a broader AI strategy.  
   - Standardize AI infrastructure and technology operating models.  
   - Create a roadmap covering a variety of use cases.  
   - Move from experimentation to consistent organizational practice.  

4. **Expand**  
   - Democratize and industrialize AI.  
   - Scale proven use cases.  
   - Co-create with vendors and broaden data sources.  
   - Standardization supports technology orchestration through multiple pipelines.  
   - Example: MLOps and DevOps integration for end-to-end AI lifecycle.  

5. **Transform**  
   - Use cases support new business models and processes.  
   - Composable systems and reusable AI components.  
   - Strong governance, automation, and workforce upskilling enable sustainable transformation.

## Key Themes from Gartner’s Slides  

- **Quantifiable vs. Innovative Use Cases**  
  - Early adoption: focus on *quantifiable* use cases to prove value.  
  - Advanced adoption: prioritize *innovative* use cases that drive transformation.  

- **Budget and Governance**  
  - Budget allocation has a **3.5x impact on AI maturity**.  
  - Authority should be assigned to CIO, CTO, Information Security, and Data Science functions.  
  - Strategic vs tactical allocation shapes long-term AI success.  

- **Frameworks: Rigid vs Flexible**  
  - **Rigid frameworks**: standardized ML platforms, predefined components, strict policy flows.  
  - **Flexible frameworks**: open-source tools, user-defined approaches, adaptable to roles.  
  - Organizations evolve from rigid → flexible as AI matures.  

- **Technology and Operations**  
  - Start with off-the-shelf solutions to reduce complexity.  
  - Progress toward end-to-end AI lifecycle orchestration.  
  - Integration of MLOps + DevOps aligns AI with software development pipelines.  

- **Use Case Selection Guidance**  
  - Early: select feasible, high-value use cases (e.g., predictive ETA, appointment management).  
  - Later: expand into higher-risk, higher-reward innovations (e.g., delivery drones, autonomous vehicles).  
  - Prioritize use cases sharing the same **core data** to accelerate scaling.

## Sector Example: Transportation Use Cases  

Gartner mapped transportation AI use cases against business value and feasibility:  

- **High Feasibility & High Value**  
  - Predictive ETA  
  - Delivery Time Window Adjustments  
  - Dynamic Appointment Management  

- **Medium Value / Higher Risk**  
  - Transportation Forecasting  
  - Asset Performance  

- **Innovative/Transformational**  
  - Delivery Drones  
  - Urban Delivery Robots  
  - Autonomous Trucks
